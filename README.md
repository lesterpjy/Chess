# Chess
A game of chess played from the terminal using the standard algebraic notation.

The program assumes basic understanding of standard algebraic
notation for manipulating
chess pieces. Although it gives some simple instructions at the
beginning of the game,
if the user is unclear about anything, please refer to the wikipedia
page referenced in game.
As examples of how to play the game after 'starting the game', here
are two commands to
enter to demonstrate the program's ability.
1. white starts: e4, c5, nf3, nc6, bb5, g6, bxc6, dxc6, o-o,...
2. white starts: d4, e5, nf3, bb4,...
3. white starts: f3, e5, g4, qh4.
4. white starts: nf3, h6, d4, a6, nd2,...
For case 1, basic manipulation, capturing, and castling is shown.
In case 2, white king is in check, and for case 3, white is
checkmated.
In case 4, the disambiguation ability is shown. This can also be
achieved for
castling, but that requires moving out all pieces other than rooks
to the two sides
of the king.
Although case 3 demonstrates the checkmate ability, testing was not
exhaustive, and
it is possible that it breaks.
